_[Future Milan speaking...]_

Welcome to my "Schlag den Carl" repository! This is here mostly for historical/ sentimental reasons since it is the first actual project ever written by me. This goes back to before I've been paid to develop software (and it shows).

This was done for a friends wedding and mimics the score display from the TV show "Schlag den Raab".

In an effort to clean up my repos on this platform (and retrofit them with a README) I couldn't bring it over me to delete this one. 

So in case anyone stumbles across this... have fun reading the first thing I have ever written. For reference, 
this was _after_ I took a JS course, but _before_ I took a HTML/CSS course (looking back at it definitely the wrong order to take courses in, if you want to be a Web Dev). So at the point of building this I have never heard of CSS naming conventions, best practices or responsive design. Let alone JS Frameworks. So I was mostly making things up as I went along.  

It is deployed to https://schlag-den-carl.vercel.app/, if you want to see it in action.
